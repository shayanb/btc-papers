\begin{abstract}

In all of the excitement surrounding Bitcoin, it is easy to forget that the decentralized currency assumes a solution to the longstanding problem of designing secure and usable public key cryptography for authenticating users. Despite decades of research on this issue in parallel technologies, such as digitally signed email, we show that Bitcoin technologies for managing user keys stall on many of the same basic issues. At the same time, the developer-heavy Bitcoin community has been very prolific in producing deployed technologies with a wide variety of approaches to solving these issues. We therefore argue that studying this suite of technology offers the clearest picture yet of the challenges in usable key management for digital signatures.
