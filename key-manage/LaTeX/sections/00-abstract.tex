\begin{abstract}

Bitcoin users are directly or indirectly forced to deal with public key cryptography, which has a number of security and usability challenges that differ from the ubiquitous password-based authentication underlying most online banking services. In short, users must ensure keys are simultaneously: accessible as needed, resistant to digital theft, and resilient to inadvertent loss. We build on the decades of research into the usability of key management in other domains, such as encrypted email, showing that Bitcoin shares many of the same fundamental challenges. At the same time, some challenges are unique to Bitcoin, including the clear financial value at stake and subtle complexities within the Bitcoin protocol like change addresses. We contribute an evaluation framework for comparing a wide-breadth of Bitcoin proposals. To establish usability issues, we conduct a broad expert review of six representative deployed solutions.
