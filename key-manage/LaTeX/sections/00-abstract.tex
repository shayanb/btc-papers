We don't know if Bitcoin millionaires sleep at night, only that they shouldn't. The average user is not prepared to securely manage a large amount of Bitcoins. This is due, in large part, to Bitcoin's use of public key cryptography which forces every one of its users into the unfamiliar territory of key management. We expect this to prevent Bitcoin from gaining traction beyond its enthusiasts. In this paper, we review the state of the art in Bitcoin key management tools, with particular focus on attempts to emulate the functionality of a password-based system within Bitcoin. Each approach presents trade-offs in security, usability and availability that lead us to conclude none is a silver bullet and the area deserves further attention. We thus propose a research agenda of possible future directions in improving key management techniques for Bitcoin users in the short- and medium-term.
