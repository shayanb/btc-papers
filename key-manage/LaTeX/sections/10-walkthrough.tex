\section{Evaluation Methodology}

%intro from TOR paper -> undone citations
Another method to evaluate the usability of these techniques is heuristic evaluation (citation). In this paper, we employ cognitive walkthrough as our methodology for usability evaluation.

\subsection {The Core Tasks}
The core tasks that we are going to perform for each key management technique are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-1} \label{sec:ct-1}
\item Finalize a receiving address from the primary device\footnote{primary device is the initial device that the key is generated on} 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-2} \label{sec:ct-2}
\item Authorize the transaction from the primary device 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-3} \label{sec:ct-3}
\item Authorize the transaction from the secondary device\footnote{any device other than the primary device}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-4} \label{sec:ct-4}
\item Losing the main credential (recovery options)
\end{itemize}

The core tasks will be performed with the following clients with default configuration on each category:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Key in file (default):  \bitcoinclient 
\item Password Protected: \multibit 
\item Air gap: Bitcoin Armory \footnote{\url{https://bitcoinarmory.com/}}
\item Offline Storage: Paper Wallet
\item Password-drived key: Brain Wallet
\item Hosted: Blockchain.info wallet

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Key in file}
The first step is to download and run \bitcoinclient, as it was described in section 4.1, it would take days to sync with current block chain, that being said, core task one that is the receiving address is available right after the first run in the "Receive" tab of the application. It is possible to send any owned funds from the "Send" tab of the application, also If the user clicks on his bitcoin address the "sign message" button would be enabled that the user could sign a custom message or just to show that he owns the address, this would be the CT2 as authorizing the transaction. CT-3 is not easily possible with \bitcoinclient as the new installation is needed on the new device thus new wallet is generated, however user can replace his own wallet with the newly generated one to have access to the funds. As for CT4, if the user loses \walletfile, there is no way to recover the lost keys.


\subsubsection{Password Protected}
Analysis of the core tasks for the this section was done on \multibit that one of the most used bitcoin clients among newer users due to usage of SPV protocol and less time to sync the blockchain to show the updated amount of funds. CT1 to CT3 are the same as above technique, however for CT4, whether user has forgot his passphrase on the encrypted wallet or loses his wallet file, it is unlikely to recover the keys.


\subsubsection{Air gap}
\label{sec:air gap}


\subsubsection{Offline Storage}
There are different options for Offline Storage of a bitcoin as described in Section \ref{offline storage}. For the cognitive walkthrough we choose the paper wallet to include a different approach of saving the keys as the other methods has similar parts to key in file or the Air gap technique.\\
For CT1 user could enter any of the bitcoin paper wallet sites (e.g www.bitaddress.org). By mouse movement or adding some text to the proposed fields, user can make a random seed to generate a random unpredictable address. The address would appear on the left of the screen with the private key on the right labeled as secret. As for CT2 and CT3 there is no difference in the primary device and the secondary as the key should be imported from the paper wallet into the wallet client. The best way to do so is to have an online wallet on blockchain.info or use the Bitcoin Armory application to import the private key or use the signing transaction option to authorize the transaction. On loosing the key (CT4) there is no way to recover the keys without the use of any other backups.

\subsubsection{Password-drived key}
To start using this technique user has to either run the offline brain wallet or use the online services such as brainwallet.org. On entering the site user is asked to enter a customized personal string to produce the random seed to generate the bitcoin address (CT1). For example with the string "brainwallet strong password" the address of \\ "12HH5MmDhPsZWLb1QZKhptzGpPG1R73gwy" has been generated. note that the string should not be shared or the funds would be available to whoever that has the string. Same as the offline storage on any system that has access to the software it is possible to produce the keys from the users string so CT2 and CT3 are the same and easy to do on any system. On forgetting the credentials, it would be impossible to recover the keys (CT4).


\subsubsection{Hosted}
Hosted services are the easiest ones to use for the new users. There would be a sign up for an online wallet that we chose blockchain.info \footnote{\url{https://blockchain.info/wallet}} as it is the most famous online wallet on the time of the writing. The user clicks on "Start a new wallet" and provides an email address with a password for his login. On the first page it has a warning that on forgetting the password there is no way to recover the account (CT4), however it gives the user a "Wallet Recovery Mnemonic" that is a set of words that could be used to recover the account. On the first login the user would have a finalized address that he can use to receive and send bitcoins. The interface is pretty user-friendly and easy to use. As for CT2 and CT3 there is no difference between the devices as a simple web browser would give access to the account for the user.
