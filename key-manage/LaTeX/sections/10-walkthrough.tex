%intro from TOR paper -> undone citations
Another method to evaluate the usability of these techniques is heuristic evaluation (citation). In this paper, we employ cognitive walkthrough as our methodology for usability evaluation.

\subsection {The Core Tasks}
The core tasks that we are going to perform for each key management technique are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-1} \label{sec:ct-1}
\item Finalize a receiving address from the primary device\footnote{primary device is the initial device that the key is generated on} 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-2} \label{sec:ct-2}
\item Authorize the transaction from the primary device 
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-3} \label{sec:ct-3}
\item Authorize the transaction from the secondary device\footnote{any device other than the primary device}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bf CT-4} \label{sec:ct-4}
\item Losing the main credential (recovery options)
\end{itemize}

The core tasks will be performed with the following clients with default configuration on each category:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Key in file (default):  \bitcoinclient 
\item Password Protected: \multibit 
\item Air gap: Bitcoin Armory \footnote{\url{https://bitcoinarmory.com/}}
\item Offline Storage: Paper Wallet
\item Password-drived key: Brain Wallet
\item Hosted: Blockchain.info wallet

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Usability Guidelines} %copied from TOR paper with some small modifications!

	The set of guidelines that we use to evaluate each of the core tasks are as follows.
	
\begin{description}
	\item[G1] Users should be aware of the steps they have to perform to complete a core task.
	\item[G2] Users should be able to determine how to perform these steps.
	\item[G3] Users should know when they have successfully completed a core task.
	\item[G4] Users should be able to recognize, diagnose, and recover from non-critical errors.
	\item[G5] Users should not make dangerous errors from which they cannot recover.
	\item[G6] Users should be comfortable with the terminology used in any interface dialogues or documentation.
	\item[G7] Users should be sufficiently comfortable with the interface to continue using it.
	\item[G8] Users should be aware of the application's status at all times.
\end{description}

	These guidelines are drawn from a variety of sources \cite{cw,johnny,karat,p3p,pvo,clark} and are intended for evaluating Bitcon Key management specifically. However they are suitably broad and may find application in other usable privacy walkthroughs. We now individually justify the inclusion of each.
	
\subsubsection*{G1: Users should be aware of the steps they have to perform to complete a core task.} This is a restatement of the first guideline of Whitten and Tygar \cite{johnny}. Every user of a new application knows certain things before using the system and learns certain things during the use of the system. In the cognitive walkthroughs we carry out here, the presupposition is that the user knows enough to start the process for each core task---in the case of installation, the user can download the installation file and open it; in the case of configuration, the user can explore the user interface or follow cues. We are evaluating how the application cues the user to perform the intermediary steps between these broadly defined tasks. 
	
\subsubsection*{G2: Users should be able to determine how to perform these steps.} Once the user is aware of what intermediary steps are necessary, she must be able to figure out how to perform these steps. This is the second guideline in \cite{johnny}. It is assumed the user has a mental model of how the system works. It is thus important that the system model be harmonized with the user's mental model if the user is to be successful in performing the necessary steps required to complete each core task  \cite{cw}. What is less obvious is why we cannot fully rely on the user to simply modify her mental model when given conflicting information.

A predominate reason is that humans have a stronger preference for confirming evidence than disconfirming evidence when evaluating their own hypotheses. This cognitive bias is well illustrated by Wason \cite{bias1}, who conducted a study where a set of subjects were given the following sequence of numbers: 2,4,6. The subjects were told that the numbers followed a rule, and their task was to determine the rule by proposing their own sequence of numbers, which would be declared as matching the rule or not. The rule was any ascending sequence of numbers. However most subjects derived a more complicated rule, such as every ascending sequence of numbers differing by two. The point of this test was that the subjects, on average, had a preconceived idea of what the rule was and only proposed sequences to confirm that rule, instead of also proposing sequences that would falsify their perceived rule.

Confirmation bias is important in usability because it proposes that users are biased toward only seeking and accepting information that confirms their mental model, and thus may avoid or even ignore information that contradicts it. It cannot reasonably be expected that users will easily and quickly adapt their mental model to new information.

A second concern with how users perform these steps is that security is a secondary goal \cite{johnny,karat}. If the user is given two paths to completing a core task---one that is fast but not secure, and one that is slower but more secure--it cannot be assumed that the user will take the latter approach. In fact, studies in behavioural economics demonstrate that humans often prefer smaller immediate payoffs to larger future payoffs, such as \$50 today instead of \$100 a year from today \cite{bias2}. Using software securely has a greater (usually non-monetary) payoff for the user, but this utility has to be substantially higher than the alternative to justify the delay in achieving it.

\subsubsection*{G3: Users should know when they have successfully completed a core task.} In other words, users should be provided with ample feedback during the task to ensure they are aware of its successful completion. This principle has been proposed in the context of heuristic evaluation \cite{cw} and for a cognitive walkthrough \cite{pvo}. It was also mentioned by Cranor \cite{p3p}. In Bitcoins, it is essential that the user is provided with confirmation of the task's finalization, such as successful back up of \walletfile.

\subsubsection*{G4: Users should be able to recognize, diagnose, and recover from non-critical errors.} Users will likely make errors in performing the core tasks and it is important for them to be able to recover from these errors \cite{cw}. It is important for users to be given concise error messages.

\subsubsection*{G5: Users should not make dangerous errors from which they cannot recover.} This guideline is from Whitten and Tygar \cite{johnny}. In Bitcoin subject, the most dangerous error is to reveal the private key which is associated with the address that holds the funds. Also in case of backups, the corrupted \walletfile would be useless for recovery.

\subsubsection*{G6: Users should be comfortable with the language used in any interface dialogues or documentation.} Wharton \textit{et al.} emphasize that applications should use simple, natural, and familiar language \cite{cw}. 

%This is also a central design goal for Privacy Bird \cite{p3p}, which takes natural language privacy policies and translates them from legalese into concise, human readable summaries. In the case of Tor, Privoxy, Torpark, \textit{etc.}, we are looking at the understandability of dialogues and the documentation, and their reliance on technical language which users may have trouble understanding.

\subsubsection*{G7: Users should be comfortable with the interface.} This is the fourth principle of usable security of Whitten and Tygar \cite{johnny}, and is an essential part of the principal of psychological acceptability quoted by Bishop \cite{pa}. 

%While Tor and Privoxy do not have an extensive user interface, we will be evaluating it in terms of how intuitive it is to use. We will also be analysing the interface of the Firefox extensions.

\subsubsection*{G8: Users should be aware of the system status at all times.} This principle was proposed in the context of heuristic evaluation \cite{cw} and cognitive walkthrough \cite{pvo}. Cranor advocates the use of `persistent indicators' that allow the user to see all the required information at a glance \cite{p3p}. In terms of Bitcoin, we are looking for indicators that show the balance and the addresses that is included in the \walletfile and also the transaction history.

%===========================================================
\subsubsection{Key in file}
First step for user is to download the \bitcoinclient from bitcoin.org website\footnote{\url{https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet}}. For the first time user choosing between the wallets and figuring out which section of the site to start  with might be confusing, However it is much more user-friendly now than when bitcoin was introduced. When clicking on \bitcoinclient download option, the page shows different types of operating systems compatible files to be downloaded, albeit, the default download button would automatically determine the system the user is using and downloads the relative setup file. It has a pretty straight forward wizard installation procedure. Now the user runs the application for the first time. On the first run user would see the main page of the application that might be confusing for him because it needs to sync with blockchain to show the information instead of just saying "Out of Sync", however the first task that is to have an bitcoin address is done (CT1), and he can find the address with clicking on the "Receive Coins" tab of the application but might be confused with the "Addresses" tab that is like a contact list for other addresses, this being said, he would not see the final balance until the sync is done (this might take days and about 10GB of storage space and also violates G8 as there is no indication of how long this would take to be synced), Although G1,G2 and G3 are slightly violated, There is no indication or pop ups that the address has been made and is ready to use or the balance is not yet finalized. As for CT2, the minimum knowledge of bitcoin addresses is needed, to not to make any mistakes. for example if the receiving address is in the wrong format, there is no error to show that is so but just a red background appears on the address that is a slight violation of G4. For Backing up the \walletfile, after clicking on the "Backup Wallet" in "File" and choosing the directory there is no sign that the backup has been successfully done and incase of any problems the keys are not recoverable (G5), however on encrypting the wallet the message box indicates that on losing the passphrase there is no way to recover the encrypted keys (CT4). CT3 is not easily possible with \bitcoinclient as the new installation is needed on the new device thus new wallet is generated, however user can replace his own wallet with the newly generated one to have access to the funds, but nothing has been mentioned about this in the documentation(G1). 


%The first step is to download and run \bitcoinclient, as it was described in section 4.1, it would take days to sync with current block chain, that being said, core task 1 that is the receiving address is available right after the first run in the "Receive" tab of the application. It is possible to send any owned funds from the "Send" tab of the application, also If the user clicks on his bitcoin address the "sign message" button would be enabled that the user could sign a custom message or just to show that he owns the address, this would be the CT2 as authorizing the transaction. CT-3 is not easily possible with \bitcoinclient as the new installation is needed on the new device thus new wallet is generated, however user can replace his own wallet with the newly generated one to have access to the funds. As for CT4, if the user loses \walletfile, there is no way to recover the lost keys.


\subsubsection{Password Protected}
Although it is possible to encrypt the \walletfile with \bitcoinclient, there is no emphasize or alerts to do so, however in \multibit client one of the first steps is to password protect the wallet file, this is one of the reasons that this client has been chosen to be analyses for this cognitive walkthrough, also because it uses SPV for faster blockchain synchronization this client is more popular among new users.
The download\footnote{\url{https://multibit.org/}} and installation process is really straightforward. On the first run the welcome page would pop up that has the explanation of the core tasks that could be done with \multibit such as where the send, requenst and transaction tabs are and how to password protect your wallet and also help options for all the other functionalities (G1,G2). Unlike \bitcoinclient, \multibit help option gives direct and non-technical guides on how to do the desired functions. The interface is pretty easy to understand and it shows the status of the program (Online, offline, out of sync) on the left down side, the balance of the user's wallet on the up left and the latest price of bitcoin on the up left of the window(G8). There are not too many jargons and technical vocabulary used (G6). Same as the "key in file" after the first run the receiving address in finalized and it is possible to receive bitcoins (CT1). For CT2, the user would know that he needs to send some funds to another address, it is by clicking on the "send" tab, \multibit has a really simple and complete interface to do so(G7), where it is possible to import the sending address by QRcode\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code}} or from the clipboard or by typing it in the "Address" field. If the address in not correctly formatted or the amount of the transaction is more than the balance, a fully detailed error message would pop up to explain what went wrong (G4). The interface also shows the USD value of the transaction amount on the side of the bitcoin amount. With the main Functionalities, CT3 would not be possible, but it is possible to export the private keys and import them on the secondary device to do the transactions. To do so, user would look on the menus and finds the option "Export Private Keys". By default the password protected backup is enabled and needs to input the password and incase user disables it, there would be a red sign saying "Any one who reads your export file could spend your bitcoins", also on clicking the export button there would be the message confirming that the backup has been completed and the second check that is to match the backup with the current wallet info has been done (G5). Now with this exported file in hand the user can do an "Import Private Keys" on any given computer (secondary device) to authorize a transaction (CT3) and also do a recovery of the lost wallet file (CT4).

%Analysis of the core tasks for the this section was done on \multibit that one of the most used bitcoin clients among new users due to usage of SPV protocol and less time to sync the blockchain to show the updated amount of funds. CT1 to CT3 are the same as "Key in file" technique, however for CT4, whether user has forgot his passphrase on the encrypted wallet or loses his wallet file, it is unlikely to recover the keys.


\subsubsection{Air gap}
\label{sec:air gap}


\subsubsection{Offline Storage}
There are different options for Offline Storage of a bitcoin as described in Section \ref{offline storage}. For the cognitive walkthrough we choose the paper wallet to include a different approach of saving the keys as the other methods has similar parts to key in file or the Air gap technique.\\
For CT1 user could enter any of the bitcoin paper wallet sites (e.g www.bitaddress.org). By mouse movement or adding some text to the proposed fields, user can make a random seed to generate a random unpredictable address. The address would appear on the left of the screen with the private key on the right labeled as secret. As for CT2 and CT3 there is no difference in the primary device and the secondary as the key should be imported from the paper wallet into the wallet client. The best way to do so is to have an online wallet on blockchain.info or use the Bitcoin Armory application to import the private key or use the signing transaction option to authorize the transaction. On loosing the key (CT4) there is no way to recover the keys without the use of any other backups.

\subsubsection{Password-drived key}
To start using this technique user has to either run the offline brain wallet or use the online services such as brainwallet.org. On entering the site user is asked to enter a customized personal string to produce the random seed to generate the bitcoin address (CT1). For example with the string "brainwallet strong password" the address of \\ "12HH5MmDhPsZWLb1QZKhptzGpPG1R73gwy" has been generated. note that the string should not be shared or the funds would be available to whoever that has the string. Same as the offline storage on any system that has access to the software it is possible to produce the keys from the users string so CT2 and CT3 are the same and easy to do on any system. On forgetting the credentials, it would be impossible to recover the keys (CT4).


\subsubsection{Hosted}
Hosted services are the easiest ones to use for the new users. There would be a sign up for an online wallet that we chose blockchain.info \footnote{\url{https://blockchain.info/wallet}} as it is the most famous online wallet on the time of the writing. The user clicks on "Start a new wallet" and provides an email address with a password for his login. On the first page it has a warning that on forgetting the password there is no way to recover the account (CT4), however it gives the user a "Wallet Recovery Mnemonic" that is a set of words that could be used to recover the account. On the first login the user would have a finalized address that he can use to receive and send bitcoins. The interface is pretty user-friendly and easy to use. As for CT2 and CT3 there is no difference between the devices as a simple web browser would give access to the account for the user.
