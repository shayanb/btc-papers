\subsection{Bitcoin Background}
%davidb. make sure you say here that bitcon generates a new keypair for every transaction, and those get stored in the wallet.dat . the default client starts with 100 privkeys (called a keypool), and generates 100 at a time when you run out. you can change this by running keypool=n on the command line. btw this is done so you can back up your wallet.dat once, and as long as you don't make more than 100 addr you don't need to back up every time.

  \item Same paradigm
  \item SSH - nerds
  \item PGP - turbo nerds
  \item SSL - client certs (no one, or spooks)
  \item SSL - server
