\subsection{Password-Derived Key} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item entropy reduction
  \item salt, iteration count
  \item parsing (spec that was followed) requires a tool. if you lose the tool, you may not be able to recover your keys. standard may not be detailed enough, or not properly implemented.
  \item change accounts gets messy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hosted (Hot Storage)} 
One easier way to manage your bitcoin wallet is by using online wallets. It has it's own advantages and cutbacks. Trusting third party is one issue and the party getting hacked is another. There has been known trustable third parties that just went out of business on their first big hacks, such as instawallet\footnote{\url{http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/3/4180020/bitcoin-service-instawallet-suspended-indefinitely-after-hack}}, Bitcoinica\footnote{\url{http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233711/second-bitcoin-lawsuit-is-filed-in-california}}, etc. Bitcoinica in 2012 lost more than 60,000 bitcoins due to two successful attacks.
\begin{itemize}
  % \item trusted party. they can steal if malicious,
  % \item they're good, but don't have good security. external hackers stealing (instawallet, Mybitcoin %Aleks lost 51% of his deposit there...)

  \item legitimate shutdown. legal implications (affidavit)
  \item web service, so any attack (phishing, xss) or DDoS (Mt Gox http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4181726/bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-says-technical-problems-are-ddos)
  \item phishing: Coinbase \url{http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/5/4186808/bitcoin-banker-coinbase-phishing-attacks-user-information-leaked}

\subsection{Hosted (Cold Storage)} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Offline wallets aka cold storage. not immediately available, transactions queueing up (coinbase).
