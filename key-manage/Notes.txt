Introduction

Background

Motivation
*Different paradigm: protecting a key vs protecting a password. 
*Thesis: users aren't ready to manage keys. 
*State of the art in terms of usability is to somehow convert the key into a password
**security and deployability (availability) problems
**keys=something you have. 

You're serious about using your keys
*manage wallet.dat (default)
**malware getting the file
**hard drive failure, switch computer, format
**unintentional sharing (p2p, backups, work computer IT staff, shared computer)
*password protecting your keys
**malware, offline attack
**mental model. you may think that you're making your password into a key, but it's actually 2 factor
*offline storage
**print privkey to paper (paper wallet) (bitbills)
**put key onto usb
**mini cog walkthrough. how easy is it to import they back. 

How to convert your key into a password

*PBKDF2 aka brain wallets
**entropy reduction. cf online banking (cormac herley). 
**salt?
**parsing (spec that was followed) requires a tool. if you lose the tool, you may not be able to recover your keys. standard may not be detailed enough, or not properly implemented.

*HOSTED WALLETS (hot storage)
**trusted party. they can steal if malicious.
**they're good, but don't have good security. external hackers stealing
**legitimate shutdown. legal implications (affidavit)
**web service, so any attack (phishing, xss)

HOSTED WALLETS (cold storage)
*Offline wallets aka cold storage. not immediately available, transactions queueing up (coinbase). 

RESEARCH AGENDA
*better import/export of keys
*better language and guidance on key management 
*how do you know the key is in wallet.dat ?  
*publishing public keys. people need to keep these around, and they can use to check if they have the right privkey. 
*if you have your pubkey and you have the salt, you can avoid rainbow tables, but your pubkeys get longer. (add salt via commitcoin) 
*boyen iterated hashing of passwords -> compute amount of iterations based on money, script
*digital death
*sinkhole accounts
*incentives are there because it's money. not like ssh or ssl. 
*bitbills
*making it easier to split wallets to hedge lost
